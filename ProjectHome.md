The purpose of the class CFFTWWrapper is to build an easy to use interface around the FFTW Library. The class in no way utilizes the full potential of the FFTW Library but completely suffices the need of this plugin, namely computing FFT and Inverse FFT in 2D for a given Image Processing Algorithm. The algorithm/filter can be implemented in-between the FFT and iFFT steps using convolution and de-convolution.
